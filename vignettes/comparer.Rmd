When coding, especially for data science, there are multiple
ways to solve each problem.
When presented with two options, you want to pick the one
that is faster and/or more accurate.
Comparing different code chunks on the same task can be tedious.
It often requires creating data, writing a for loop
(or using `sapply`), then comparing.

The comparer package makes this comparison quick and simple:

* The same data can be given in to each model.

* Various metrics can be used to judge results,
including using the predicted errors from the code.

* The results are displayed in a table that allows you
to quickly judge the results.
