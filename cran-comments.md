I submitted yesterday and was told to make the Title title-case. I changed it from 'Compare the output and run time of R code' to 'Compare Output and Run Time'.

## Test environments
* local Window 7 install, R 3.4.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
